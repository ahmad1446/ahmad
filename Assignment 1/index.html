        <h2>About Me</h2>         
        <p>I graduated from Gran High School with an excellent GPA, a reflection of my dedication
             and persistence throughout my academic journey. This accomplishment has not only laid a strong 
             foundation for my future success but has also fueled my ambition to advance in the field of 
             Cybersecurity, a discipline I am passionately pursuing at the University of Jeddah.
              My goal is to contribute meaningfully to the industry by continuously enhancing
               my knowledge and skills, aiming to stay ahead in this ever-evolving field. 
               The journey has just begun, and I am committed to maximizing every opportunity that brings me 
               closer to my dream of making a significant impact in Cybersecurity.
               I have a passion for learning and continually expanding my knowledge in various technologies, 
             including web development and Linux.</p>
